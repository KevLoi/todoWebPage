        <h1> Thor Odinson </h1>
        <h3 style="text-align: center"> Born in Asgard, thousands of years ago </h3>
        <h3 style="text-align: center"> Contact: The Avengers </h3>

        <p> Thor had an idyllic childhood, brought up in Asgard as the most treasured son of King Odin and his wife Frigga. His best friend and playmate was his adopted brother Loki, and though the brothers were both rivals for their father's throne, they still remained close companions. Loki was taught magic by their mother, while Thor was taught how to be a warrior by their father. During his youth, Thor fostered a strong desire to be a member of the Valkyries, until he learned they were an elite group of only female soldiers. </p>

        <p> Brought up in the warrior culture of the Asgardians, Thor valued strength, courage, and loyalty above all else. He desired to be exactly like his father, Odin, the war hero who had defeated Laufey during the Asgard-Jotunheim War and brought peace across the Nine Realms. To help him become a warrior, Thor received the powerful hammer, Mjølnir to be his companion when he became king, allowing him to gain the ability to control thunder. </p>

        <p> Thor proved himself a great warrior, often leading his own band of warriors, which included Lady Sif, Loki, and the Warriors Three on adventures. However, he was also known to be reckless when Loki jokingly reminded him that he would be dead had he not used a smoke veil to allow them to escape during one battle. Thor also defeated Imir, a rogue Asgardian who threatened to take control of Asgard and kidnapped several Dwarves. While Imir managed to get the upper hand on Thor, he was eventually defeated when Thor electrocuted him with Mjølnir, giving Thor yet another victory to his name and increasing his large ego. </p>
